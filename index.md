## About Me

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at <a href="https://en.bjtu.edu.cn/research_n/res_1/index.htm">Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU)</a>, China, under the supervision of <a href="https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/6124/">Prof. Yaping Huang</a>.

My research interests span a wide range of fields within machine learning and computer vision, with a focus on areas related to human gaze, including gaze estimation, gaze following, and scanpath prediction. I am dedicated to leveraging gaze as a cue to address real-world human-computer interaction problems.

I enjoy engaging in academic discussions and collaborations. Currently, I am seeking opportunities for joint Ph.D. supervision through the National Scholarship for Studying Abroad program of the China Scholarship Council (CSC), which I believe will broaden my international perspective and further enhance my ability to apply gaze-based techniques to human-computer interaction challenges.

## Research Interests
Using computer vision and machine learning techniques to leverage gaze as a cue in addressing human-computer interaction problems.
- **Computer Vision:** gaze estimation, gaze following, scanpath prediction.
- **Machine Learning:** uncertainty estimation, domain generalization.
